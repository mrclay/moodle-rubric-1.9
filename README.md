This is the [Rubric mod](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=92646&parent=445584) updated for Moodle 1.9.12. (same for 1.9.11)

Spencer Creasey created the rubric mod based on mod/assignment from Moodle 1.9.1 (or thereabouts). I carefully merged in the changes to Moodle's core assignment mod made between 1.9.1 and 1.9.12, [Nigel Pegram's patch](https://github.com/mrclay/moodle-rubric-1.9/commit/f6e3a3e8f4e22af7835754e8579f02a855c3a29c#L17R43), and a [PHP5.3 bug fix](https://github.com/mrclay/moodle-rubric-1.9/commit/f6e3a3e8f4e22af7835754e8579f02a855c3a29c#L6R23).

I'll update this as new Moodle 1.9.x releases are made and tag each commit with the compatible Moodle version.
